# FAQ

Frequently asked questions (and answers) regarding the Eupnea Project.

## Will Depthboot/EupneaOS remove my ChromeOS installation?

Only if you choose to do so. Neither Depthboot nor EupneaOS will remove your ChromeOS installation, unless you
explicitly choose to do so.

## When will EupneaOS be ready?

We don't know. We are working on it, but we have no ETA.

## Why is sharing Depthboot images illegal?

The Depthboot base distros all allow image/iso/rootfs sharing, but only in an unmodified form. The Depthboot script
customizes some internal distro behavior (for example it [disables deep sleep](/docs/chromebook/bootlock)) and
thereby creates modified images.
To allow modified images to be shared, all trademarked content would have to be removed, i.e. all Distro logos.

## Why is sharing EupneaOS images illegal?

EupneaOS does not have the same restrictions as the Depthboot base distros, as all trademarked content has been removed.
The Eupnea Project disallows sharing of EupneaOS images, to prevent unofficial modded versions from being distributed.
If you want to create a fork of EupneaOS, remove all trademarked content, i.e. the name and logos.
